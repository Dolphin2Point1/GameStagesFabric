# GameStagesFabric
Basically just [gamestages](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Game-Stages) but for fabric. 
The API is different but the idea is the same.

###Checklist

-[x] API
-[ ] Item Module
-[ ] Block Module (so you can't use certain blocks)
-[ ] Mob Module (so you can't spawn certain mobs)

(might add more later but these seem like some of the more important ones)

# GameStagesFabric
Basically just [Game-Stages](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Game-Stages) but for fabric. 
The API is different but the idea is the same.

### Checklist

- [x] API
- [x] Item Module
- [ ] Block Module (so you can't use certain blocks)
- [ ] Mob Module (so you can't spawn certain mobs)

(might add more later but these seem like some of the more important ones)
